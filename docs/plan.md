## Phase 1: Conceptualization & Curation

Define Visual Identity: Select a limited color palette (monochromatic or neutral) and a primary typeface pairing.

Curate Content: Select your strongest projects, ensuring they align with a minimalist aesthetic.

Information Architecture: Map out a simple site map (e.g., Home/Work, About, Contact).

## Phase 2: Wireframing & Layout

Low-Fidelity Sketching: Outline basic structures focusing on the Bento Grid or large-scale typography layouts.

Grid Definition: Establish a consistent spacing system to ensure perfect alignment and balance across all pages.

Responsiveness: Plan how the minimalist layout will adapt to mobile screens without losing its "breathability."

## Phase 3: High-Fidelity Design

Visual Prototyping: Create the final UI in your preferred design tool, focusing on hierarchy and white space.

Asset Preparation: Optimize project images and videos for fast loading and high resolution.

Refining Details: Fine-tune micro-interactions and hover states to add a layer of sophistication.

## Phase 4: Implementation & Testing

Structure Building: Translate the design into a functional template using your chosen platform or code.

QA & Optimization: Test navigation flow, link functionality, and loading speeds.

Launch: Deploy the site and conduct a final review to ensure the "less is more" philosophy is consistent throughout.
